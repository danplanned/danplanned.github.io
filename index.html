      <p>
        D-Stratos was unofficially founded in 2025. This was during the time
        when I was a business analyst working in Healthcare, but I wanted to do
        more. So I took a software development course and picked up web
        development. After consulting and discussing with my dad about what I
        can do with tese set of skills, he asked me if I wanted to give back to
        the community? I asked him how would I be able to and he said to go to
        small local businesses around orange county and offer to build them a
        website at a small price. That way I would gain more experience, gain a
        network or people who can vouch for me and even one day support me when
        I make this official. Thank you to mom and dad for always supporting me
        in all the things I do.
