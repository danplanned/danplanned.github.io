  <h1><span class = "highlight">D-Stratos</span></h1>
  <p>D-Stratos was unofficially founded in 2025. This was during the time when I was a business analyst working in Healthcare, but I wanted to do more. So I took a software development course and picked up web development. After consulting and discussing with my dad about what I can do with tese set of skills, he asked me if I wanted to give back to the community? I asked him how would I be able to and he said to go to small local businesses around orange county and offer to build them a website at a small price. That way I would gain more experience, gain a network or people who can vouch for me and even one day support me when I make this official. Thank you to mom and dad for always supporting me in all the things I do.</p>
